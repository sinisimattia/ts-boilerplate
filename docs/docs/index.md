Let's imagine that you have a class, we'll call it `TestClass`, you can document it and put code snippets
and you'll have code highlighting out of the box!

```typescript
class TestClass {
	public param1: string;
	public param2: string;
	public list: string[];
    public thing: AnotherClass;
}
```

Make your docs easy to understand and provide lots of examples!
